# Trajectory-Data-Mining

A collection of data mining techniques of geolocation data. A canonical dataset would be the GeoLife dataset contributed by Microsoft.

I have tried to build my own animations using matplotlib but it is too tedious to do so, especially when my main goal is to analyse the data, not so much about visualising it.

Other interesting visualisation tools include:
- D3
- Streamlit
- Kepler
